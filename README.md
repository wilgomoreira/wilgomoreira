### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**wilgomoreira/wilgomoreira** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and JAVA
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JAVA
-
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have worked with development software in 2006 for 3 years. I worked with C++. After that, I never used C++ again
